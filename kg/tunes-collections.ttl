It consists of over 75,000 entries that are sorted by text (titles, first lines, recitatives, chorus and burden), by music incipits (represented in scale degrees, stressed notes and interval sequences), with additional indexes of names and theater works. Now in electronic format, the data can be fully searched, not only for initial strings, but also for internal words and melody sections." ;

        core:comment      "Between 1963 and 1999, Irish State publishing companies Oifig an tSolatáthair and An Gúm issued five printed volumes of tunes from the collections of Breadán Breathnach (1912-1985) under the series title Ceol Rince na hÉireann (Dance Music of Ireland, hereafter CRÉ). The five volumes of CRÉ contain 1,208 traditional tunes, a subset of Breathnach's more extensive personal collection of 5,000+ melodies. The collection has been transcribed into ABC notation by American traditional music researcher Bill Black, and made freely available online via his personal website. Addition of alternative tune versions and variation in numbering of unique melodies has resulted in a total of 1,224 tunes in the Bill Black ABC corpus. This resource has been used in previous research work, for example it makes up part of a larger aggregated corpus used in the Tunepal Music Information Retrieval app. We have created a new cleaned and annotated version of the corpus, from which feature sequence data can be extracted and analysed via Polifonia's FONN music pattern analysis toolkit." ;
